# ProgrammableScaffoldRails

This gem should remove repeated code when rails scaffolding, expecially on controllers.  
It's useful when you are prototyping and when you are just building an application with a lot of simple **CRUD**.  
It's also configurable, to avoid as most as possible to completely override one of the default controllers method, unless you are doing something really special.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'programmable_scaffold_rails', '~> 0.0.1'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install programmable_scaffold_rails

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here
In your Controller (or in ApplicationController) include the module:

    include ProgrammableScaffoldRails::ActionControllerExtensions
